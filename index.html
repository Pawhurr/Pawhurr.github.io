            <!-- <p style="padding-top: 20px">Born in England, and having lived in several different states in the U.S., I have a love for travel and a unique outlook on the world.  I have a passion for puzzle solving and art which has led me to channel those passions into a career in coding and web development.  My educational background consists of a Bachelor's in Art from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and I feel the combination of my coding pursuits and artistic background lend themselves nicely into me being successful in the field of web development.</p><br> -->
            <p style="padding-top: 20px">The majority of my professional career centers around communicating well to a variety of audiences and working as part of a team to get the job done.  My most recent experience proved my strong work ethic by requiring me to be self-motivated to manage my workload to complete tasks unsupervised.  I am a results-driven full-stack web developer with a passion for creativity and design which ties in well with my Bachelorâ€™s in Art from UNCC.  I would love to work as a front-end developer creating intuitive, interactive elements and pleasing design utilizing my strengths in JavaScript, jQuery and CSS.  My goal is to work in an environment that connects like-minded people in a place of creativity and problem solving that fosters collaboration.</p>
            <p>I currently live in Charlotte, North Carolina, with my wife, Jillian, my two sons, Lincoln and Oliver, my dog, Sully, and my two cats, Levi and Juno.  An avid video game player and cinephile, I am always up to talk about movies or games, and my wife and I are huge Disney fans, too.  We even honeymooned there.  On the weekends, you can probably find me where there is a good food truck or brewery, as long as we are not out of town for the weekend.  Let me know if you need restaurant recommendations, too, as we always try to hit the newest ones in the Charlotte area.</p>
