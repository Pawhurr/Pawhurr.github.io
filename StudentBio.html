                    <p>I was originally born in England and moved to the U.S. with my family as a child.  From there I moved around a lot and lived in Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and finally to North Carolina.  I have lived here for sixteen years now and graduated from UNC Charlotte with a degree in Art.</p>
                
                    <p>My work experience after college has been as a manager at a retail store, selling cars at a dealership, and cleaning pools for a pool company.  I have finally taken the steps to follow a path that will be a great career for me in something that I have always been interested in with coding and web development.</p>
